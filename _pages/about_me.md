  <div class="about-text">
    <p>My ambition is to help realise an environmentally sustainable, socially just, and economically thriving society. I was introduced to life cycle assessment (LCA) in 2020 during my MSc at UCL and I believe LCA is a powerful tool to measure environmental impacts and form tangible sustainability strategies.</p>

    <p>I have over 5 years of experience conducting LCA, carbon, and sustainability projects. Currently, I’m a Senior Sustainability Consultant at Minviro, partnering with global companies to build sustainable supply chains for raw materials and energy technologies. I also provide independent consulting on LCA, critical reviews, and advisory, being an accredited practitioner of the Institute of Environmental Management (PIEMA) and Society for the Environment (REnvP).</p>

    <p>With a PhD from the University of Bath, my research on LCA for future transport and energy systems has been published in leading journals and presented internationally. I’ve also contributed to policy initiatives, including the UK’s Seventh Carbon Budget with the Climate Change Committee and the Zero Carbon Construction Policy for Bath & Northeast Somerset.</p>
